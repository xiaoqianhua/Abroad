                    If you have too many distractions around to focus, you can
                    either block these distractions or get away from them.
                    If the distractions don’t depend on you (loud conversations in the room, etc.),
                    you can go to a quiet place to work if there is a chance. Many offices today 
                    have quiet rooms and different spots for work; students usually go to libraries.
                    If the distractions come from you (checking email or social networks),
                    you can use different programs to block them.In two words: Emotional Intelligence.

                    Intelligence — or EQ — has existed since the beginning of time.

        			Reading is great if you have time. If time is limited, 
                    it is better to try and do something intuitively. At the end,
                    it is better to try and regret than not to try and regret your 
                    whole life. Students often complete assignments without wasting 
                    much time on reading how these assignments should be done. Sometimes 
                    it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but it is still worth trying.
